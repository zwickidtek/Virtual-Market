# Virtual-Market
<h1>This is my Virtual Market project created with the Flask framework for Python. </h1>
Some of the technologies I explored while creating this project include:
- User validation and password encryption with Flask and SQL
- Using servers to store (encrypted) user information and products on the market with SQL
- Relating and updating the database with a user's owned items and balance with SQL
- Routing users to different HTML templates with Flask
